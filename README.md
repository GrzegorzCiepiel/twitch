# Twich Gaming Data Analyse with SQLite and python

## Introduction

Twitch is the worldâ€™s leading live streaming platform for gamers, with 15 million daily active users. Using data to understand its users and products is one of the main responsibilities of the Twitch Data Science Team.

In this project I use two tables that contain Twitch user's stream viewing data and chat room usage data.
I received the data as a csv files. Firstly I had to make 'twitch' database and put there my data to work on.

After that I was able to use SQL opening 'twitch' database in DB Browser.
